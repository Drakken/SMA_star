
SMA* search pseudocode

Let q be a queue.

Let root be a node containing the starting-point state of the problem.

Insert root into q.

begin loop

   If q is empty, return failure.

   Let n be the deepest cheapest node in q.

   If n is a goal, return the action path that leads from root to n.

   Let s be the next ungenerated successor of n.

   If s isn't a goal and is at the maximum search depth, set its cost to infinity.
   Otherwise, set the f-cost of s to the greater of (f-cost n) and (g(s) + h(s)).

   If all of n's successors have been generated,
      update the f-cost of n and its ancestors if necessary.

   If all of n's successors are in q, drop n from q.

   If memory is full,
    WITH STUBS: delete the stub's parent if it's not good enough
      drop the shallowest, highest-f-cost node in q,
      remove it from its parent's list of successors,
      and insert its parent into q if necessary.

   Insert s into q.

end loop
